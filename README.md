confogl webass
======

Confogl for Left4Dead2 configuration.

Working right away for GameServers.com...

 * Flat Confogl configuration.
 * Autoloader running ESL configuration so no !forcematch or !match is needed when you connect to the server... Just start a lobby, fire the game and you're done.
 * 1 admin: me, just change admins.cfg
 * server.cfg changed to appear as a WEBASS Server. Just change it or don't upload server.cfg
